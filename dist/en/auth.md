# Login and authorization

**No annotations.** One `before`, plus attributes on the routes.

```java
public class App extends JimbleApp {

	{
		before(Auth::guard);                                    // that is all

		path("/public", () -> {
			attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);                       // the whole block is public
			attribute(Auth.NO_SESSION, true);
			get("/guide", Guide::show);
		});

		get("/login",  Login::show).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
		post("/login", Login::submit).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);

		get("/requests",  RequestController::list);             // needs a login by default
		get("/approvals", ApprovalController::list).attribute(Auth.ROLE, "approver");
	}

}
```

Register `before(Auth::guard)` **first**. It decides whether the request uses a session,
so **anything that touches `session()` before it wins the race.**

## Closed by default

`Auth.PUBLIC` defaults to `false` — a login is required.

**A route someone adds without writing anything is closed.** The other way round, a route
they forgot about is silently open. Both are the same mistake; **what differs is which way
it falls.**

## Route attributes

| Attribute | Default | What it decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Auth.PUBLIC` | `false` | Whether a login is not required |
| `Auth.ROLE` | `""` | The role required. Empty means any |
| `Auth.NO_SESSION` | `false` | Whether to skip sessions entirely |
| `Auth.FULL_AUTH` | `false` | Whether **only someone who just typed their password** may pass (below) |
| `Auth.REALM` | `""` | The kind of login. Use it to **let one browser log in to two areas separately** (see "Separate sessions per kind of login") |

Write it on a block and it applies to every route in it ([Routing](./routing)).
Override it on the one route that differs.

> [!TRAP]
> **`PUBLIC` and `NO_SESSION` are separate decisions.** The login endpoints need **no

> (the 302 comes back fine and the next request is a 401 — we walked into this one).

## Logging someone in

```java
Data staff = findStaff(loginId);

if (!Auth.checkPassword(password, staff.isEmpty() ? null : staff.getString("password_hash"))) {
	context.flash().put("message", "Wrong login id or password");
	context.response().redirect("/login");
	return;
}

Auth.login(context, Principal.of(
	staff.getLong("id"), staff.getString("name"), staff.getString("role")));

context.response().redirect("/me");
```

`Auth.attemptLogin` does the whole thing: **make them wait, check, and clear the count on
success.** `Auth.login` **regenerates the session id** before storing anything, and
**saves** ([Sessions and safe defaults](./session-security)).

> [!TRAP]
> **Do not call `PasswordUtil.check` directly here.** With a `null` hash it returns
> `false` **immediately**, so **a user that does not exist answers measurably faster**

> exist.**
>
> `Auth.attemptLogin` runs one round anyway before returning `false`.
> **Do not split the message either** — that undoes the point of matching the timing.

## When someone keeps getting it wrong

`Auth.attemptLogin` **counts the failures and makes the next attempt wait.** There is
nothing to write — the code above already does it.

```
failures 1-3 ... no wait (typos)
4th ... 1 second
5th ... 2 seconds
6th ... 4 seconds     ... up to the maximum (300 seconds by default)
```

While the wait is still running it answers **429 with `Retry-After`** (like 401, whether
that becomes a redirect is your `error()` handler's decision). After a 24 hour gap the
count starts again.

**It is not "N failures, locked for M minutes".** Anything that stops an account **is a
harassment tool as it stands** — getting it wrong on purpose locks that person out.
Doubling the wait instead makes the attacker's rate effectively zero while **a real user
waits a few seconds.**

> [!TRAP]
> **Count by the login id that was typed in.** Pass the found user's database id and
> **an id that does not exist is never counted** — brute force starts with ids that do
> not exist, and **whether you are made to wait then tells someone which ids are real.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Where | The `auth_attempt` table. **Does nothing without a DB** (it says so in the log, once) |
| Keyed by | The login id (**case and surrounding spaces are normalised**, then SHA-256. It is not stored in the clear) |
| Settings | `auth.lockout.*` ([Configuration](./config)) |
| Cleanup | Automatic (once an hour, while counting a failure). `Lockout.cleanup()` if you want it by hand |
| Releasing one | `Lockout.clear(loginId)` |

**This does not replace [rate limiting](./ratelimit).** Rate limiting counts **per IP**, so
one attempt each from a thousand IPs against one account never fires. This counts **per
account**, whoever it comes from. **Use both.**

## Who is logged in

```java
Principal me = Auth.principal(context);

me.id();                  // 0 means nobody
me.name();
me.hasRole("approver");
```

**It never returns `null`.** Nobody logged in gives you `Principal.ANONYMOUS`.

A `Principal` carries **three things: id, display name, role**. Put the whole user object
in the session instead and:

- fixing a name in the DB **leaves the old one until they log in again**
- revoking a role **does nothing until the session expires**
- with cookie sessions, **all of it travels to the browser**

Load the rest from the DB when you need it. If that is expensive, that is what the
[cache](./cache) is for.

## Logging out

```java
Auth.logout(context);
```

**The whole session goes.** Clear only the login keys and the shopping cart or the draft
is **still there for the next person** (which matters on a shared machine).

On a route with `Auth.REALM`, only **that kind of login** ends (below).

## Locking someone out (logging them out everywhere else)

```java
// After a password change: keep this device, end every other login
Auth.revokeOthers(context);

// From an admin screen, a batch or MQ: end all of that person's logins (no WebContext needed)
Auth.revoke(staffId);
Auth.revoke("operator", staffId);   // with a realm
```

**On its next request, a locked-out device is turned away by `Auth.guard`.** That kind of login
is cleared, and an ordinary route answers 401. **Remember-me memories go too**, so the cookie
cannot bring them back.

Nothing hunts down sessions and deletes them. **Each person has a number (a generation); locking
them out bumps it, and sessions that logged in with an older number are no longer believed.**
That is why it works **even with cookie sessions**, whose contents live in the user's browser.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Where it applies | Requests that go through `Auth.guard`. **Even on `Auth.PUBLIC` routes** a locked-out person no longer looks logged in (`Auth.NO_SESSION` routes do not read the session, so they do not check) |
| Delay | Immediate on the server that called it. **With several servers, up to 5 seconds on the others** (`auth.revocation.cache_ttl`; `0s` reads the DB every time). At that interval only one row ("was anyone locked out?") is read; with no lockouts, nothing is re-read per user (since 2.5.2; at most once a minute) |
| Where it lives | The `auth_revocation` table (created the first time it is needed). **Only people who have been locked out** get a row |
| Realms | `revoke` with a realm ends **only that kind of login**. Other kinds of login in the same session stay |
| Upgrading | Sessions from before the upgrade keep working unless you lock someone out (**nobody is logged out on upgrade day**) |
| Without a DB | `revoke` throws `IllegalStateException`. `guard` does not check |
| Failures | `revoke` throws if it cannot write, `guard` throws if it cannot read (**so a locked-out person is never let through**) |
| Settings | `auth.revocation.*` ([Configuration](./config)) |

> [!TRAP]
> **It does not stop future logins.** Someone who knows the password can log in again after being
> locked out. To stop a stolen account, **change the password or disable the account first**, then call `revoke`.

> [!NOTE]

## Separate sessions per kind of login

When one browser should be able to log in to both, say, an operator console and a member admin
screen, put `Auth.REALM` on each block. Each kind gets its own place inside the session, so
**logging in to one does not wipe out the other.**

```java
path("/ops", () -> {
	attribute(Auth.REALM, "operator");
	attribute(Auth.ROLE, "ops");
	post("/login", Ops::login).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
	post("/login/code", Ops::code).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
	post("/logout", Ops::logout);
	get("/me", Ops::me);
});

path("/admin", () -> {
	attribute(Auth.REALM, "member");
	attribute(Auth.ROLE, "member");
	// ...
});
```

Your code does not change. `Auth.login` / `Auth.principal` / `Auth.guard` / `Auth.fullyAuthenticated` /
`Auth.logout`, and the half-finished two-factor state (`Mfa.pending` / `isPending` / `complete`), **read and
write the current route's kind.**

| | On a route with a kind |
| --- | --- |
| `Auth.login` | Writes to that kind's place and regenerates the session ID (**other kinds' logins carry over**) |
| `Auth.principal` / `guard` | Look only at that kind. Logged in only as another kind means 401 |
| `Auth.logout` | Ends **only that kind** (its remember-me and half-finished two-factor state too). If another kind is still logged in, the session ID is regenerated and the rest is kept; otherwise the whole session goes |
| `Auth.logoutAll` | Logs out of every kind (the whole session goes) |

Outside a route with a kind, pass it explicitly: `Auth.principal(context, "operator")`.

> [!TRAP]
> **Put the login, code-entry and logout routes in the same kind's block.** Put them elsewhere and
> the login lands in one place while reads go to another — **you log in and still get a 401**
> (it fails closed, so nothing leaks).

> [!TRAP]
> **If you use remember-me, give `Remember` the same kind name.** `Auth.logout` only forgets the
> remember-me of the same-named kind; with a different name the cookie would survive the logout.
> So **`Remember.issue` throws `IllegalStateException` when its kind differs from the route's** (you find out at login).
> **`Remember.restore` does nothing when the kinds differ.** An application-wide `before(Remember.restore(...))`
> (no kind) does not reach blocks that carry a kind, so give such a block its own `restore` with the same name.
>
> **Put `before(Auth::guard)` inside the block too.** Application-wide `before` filters run before a block's own,
> so an application-wide guard **answers 401 before the block's `restore` gets a chance** (a remembered user is asked to log in every time).

```java
path("/ops", () -> {
	attribute(Auth.REALM, "operator");
	before(Remember.restore("operator", Ops::findStaff));    // before the guard
	before(Auth::guard);
	// ...
});

path("", () -> {                                              // group the no-kind pages into a block as well
	before(Remember.restore(App::findMember));
	before(Auth::guard);
	// ...
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Without a kind, nothing changes.** The session keys (`__auth_id` and so on) and the
> "throw the whole session away" logout stay as they were, and sessions from before the upgrade
> still read. This is a separate setting from the two-factor and remember-me kinds (D-182 / D-183,
> the ID namespace), but you normally use the same name for both.

## Returning 401 and 403

`Auth.guard` only throws an `HttpException`. **Whether that becomes a redirect or JSON is
your `error()` handler's decision.**

```java
error((context, cause, statusCode) -> {

	if (statusCode == 401 && !context.request().acceptJson()) {
		context.response().redirect("/login");
		return;
	}

	context.response().code(statusCode).json("error", (statusCode < 500 ? cause.getMessage() : "Something went wrong on the server"));

});
```

**A missing role is a 403, not a 401.** The status code is how you say that logging in
again will not change the answer. Return 401 and people **keep trying, believing another
attempt will get them in.**

## Staying logged in (remember-me)

```java
{
	before(Remember.restore(App::findPrincipal));   // remember first
	before(Auth::guard);                            // then guard

	post("/password", Password::change).attribute(Auth.FULL_AUTH, true);
}

// Look the user up again by id. The role comes from here, so revoking one takes effect at once
private static Principal findPrincipal (long id) {
	Data staff = findStaff(id);
	return staff.isEmpty() ? null
		: Principal.of(staff.getLong("id"), staff.getString("name"), staff.getString("role"));
}
```

At login, remember them **only when the box was ticked**.

```java
Auth.login(context, principal);

if ("1".equals(request.getString("remember"))) {
	Remember.issue(context, principal);
}
```

> [!TRAP]
> **Register `before(Remember.restore(...))` before `before(Auth::guard)`.** The other way
> round, **guard decides nobody is logged in and only then do you remember them.**
>
> **Do not call `issue` unconditionally** — on a shared machine **the next person gets in.**

### A stolen cookie still cannot change the password

**This is what makes remember-me safe enough to offer.** Someone who came back through
the cookie is not "someone who just typed their password", so a route with
`attribute(Auth.FULL_AUTH, true)` answers **401**.

Put it on password changes, account deletion, payments, and contact details. In code it
is `Auth.fullyAuthenticated(context)`, but **the route attribute is the one you cannot
forget to write.**

**To limit it by time since the password was typed, set `auth.full_auth_max_age`** (default 0s, no limit).
With `15m`, a session more than 15 minutes past its login gets 401 on `Auth.FULL_AUTH` routes (ask for the password again).
A stolen session then has only a short window for the sensitive operations.

### Theft shows up

The cookie holds **`selector:validator`**, and **the validator is replaced on every use.**
A stolen cookie and the real one cannot both stay current, so **a value from before the
last rotation is the signal that one of them was copied.**

On that signal **every remembered login for that user is deleted** (and it goes in the
log). Which of the two used it first **cannot be told apart**, so deleting only one can
leave **the real user locked out and the thief still in.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Where | The `auth_remember` table. **Does nothing without a DB** |
| Cookie | `selector:validator`. **The validator is stored as SHA-256** (the selector is just the lookup key, so it is stored as is) |
| Expiry | 30 days since last use, **and** 90 days since it was issued (it always expires eventually, however much you use it) |
| Grace | For 60 seconds after a rotation the old one still works, so **parallel requests do not log people out** |
| Logout | `Auth.logout` deletes it |
| Password change | **Call `Auth.revokeOthers(context)`** (below; [Locking someone out](#locking-someone-out-logging-them-out-everywhere-else)) |
| Settings | `auth.remember.*` ([Configuration](./config)) |

> [!TRAP]
> **Call `Auth.revokeOthers(context)` when the password changes.** Without it **a stolen
> cookie and a stolen session still work** — which is the whole point of changing the password.
> **`Remember.forgetAll(userId)` alone is not enough:** it only removes remember-me memories, and
> sessions that are logged in on other devices right now keep working (`revokeOthers` calls `forgetAll` for you).

### More than one kind of login

If your IDs come from **separate tables** — an operator console and a member admin screen,
say — **pass a realm.** Without one, the memory is kept by user ID alone, so **a cookie
remembered for an operator is restored on the member screen as "the member with the same ID"**
— someone gets in as a different person without typing a password.

```java
path("/ops", () -> {
	attribute(Auth.REALM, "operator");                // the login realm matches
	before(Remember.restore("operator", Ops::findStaff));
	before(Auth::guard);
});

Remember.issue(context, principal, "operator");   // at login
Auth.revoke("operator", staffId);                 // to lock them out (memories go too)
```

- **The cookie name is split per realm** (`remember_operator`: the configured name + `_` + realm),
  so being logged in to both on the same host does not overwrite either cookie
- **Restoring also checks the realm stored with the memory.** A cookie sent under the wrong name
  still cannot get in as someone from another realm
- **A restored user is logged in under the memory's realm** (since 2.5.2). Even when
  `restore("operator", ...)` runs on a route with no realm, nobody gets in as a no-realm member
- `forgetAll` and theft detection only remove **that realm's memories for that person**
- **`Auth.logout` forgets "no realm" and every realm the application uses** (the whole session is
  dropped, so every kind of login ends)
- **Without a realm, nothing changes.** The cookie name stays the same, and memories from before
  the upgrade keep working

## "Sign in with Google" (OpenID Connect)

```java
{
	before(Auth::guard);

	// both are "no login needed, but a session is"
	get("/auth/google", Oidc.start("google"))
		.attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);

	// third argument: the code screen. Pass it if you use two-factor auth
	get("/auth/google/callback", Oidc.callback("google", App::findOrCreate, "/login/code"))
		.attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
}

// Map whoever turned up to one of your users. Return null to refuse them
private static Principal findOrCreate (OidcUser user) {

	Data staff = findByOidcKey(user.key());        // "google:1234567890"

	return staff.isEmpty() ? null
		: Principal.of(staff.getLong("id"), staff.getString("name"), staff.getString("role"));

}
```

Settings live under `auth.oidc.<name>.*` ([Configuration](./config)). **Put `client_secret`
in the environment**, never in the file. Leave the endpoints out and they are **discovered**
(`issuer` + `/.well-known/openid-configuration`). **Not at startup** — that would stop the
app from booting while the provider is down.

> [!TRAP]
> **Do not add `Auth.NO_SESSION`.** The `state`, the `nonce` and the PKCE verifier all live
> in the session, so with it **nothing is there when they come back**.
>
> `Auth.PUBLIC` you do need — this is the path people take before they are logged in.

### Authorization code + PKCE only

There is no implicit flow. `start` puts a **state, a nonce and a PKCE verifier** in the
session; `callback` checks them.

| | What it stops |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | **Login CSRF** — making you follow the attacker's code so **you end up logged into their account** |
| `nonce` | **Replay of an ID token** that was captured once |
| **PKCE** (S256) | **A stolen authorization code** — without the verifier it cannot be exchanged |

The `state` is **discarded as it is read**: being single-use is the whole point.

### Verifying the ID token

**No external library.** The `n`/`e` (RSA) and `x`/`y` (EC) a JWKS returns go back to a
public key through the JDK's `KeyFactory`, and `java.security.Signature` does the
verification.

Here is what is checked. **Every one of them passes silently if you simply do not look.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `alg` | **The header is not trusted.** Only the RS/ES entries in the table are accepted. `none` means "an empty signature counts as verified"; `HS256` means **handing the public key over as a shared secret, so anyone can sign** |
| `kid` | Picks the key. If the JWKS entry declares an `alg`, it has to match |
| `iss` | **Exact match.** A prefix match lets `https://accounts.google.com.evil.jp` through |
| `aud` | Must contain us. **If there is more than one, `azp` too** — otherwise a token minted for another client can be walked in |
| `exp` / `iat` / `nbf` | With a clock-skew allowance. **Tokens issued in the future are refused** |
| `nonce` | Must match the one we sent |

**The reason is never returned.** Answering "nonce mismatch" **lets someone measure how far
they got**. It goes in the log; the response is 401.

> [!TRAP]
> **A matching email does not link to an existing user.** The only lookup key is
> `provider + sub` (`user.key()`).

> Linking on email automatically means **one provider that does not verify email addresses
> is enough to take over an account**. To attach a provider to an existing account, make the
> user do it **explicitly while already logged in**.
>
> `user.emailVerified()` is there to read, but **whether to believe it is your call**.

### Using it with two-factor auth

**Pass the path of the code screen as the third argument.**

With it, someone who has two-factor auth enabled and arrives through "Sign in with Google"
is parked with `Mfa.pending` and sent to that screen — exactly as on the password path.

> [!TRAP]
> **Without it, that person cannot get in** (they get a 401).
> In 0.6.0 they were **silently logged in**, so **choosing "Sign in with Google" skipped
> the second factor entirely.** Refusing beats waving them through (fixed in 1.0).

If you have more than one kind of login (see "More than one kind of login" below), pass the
**realm as the fourth argument**.

```java
get("/ops/auth/google/callback"
	, Oidc.callback("google", Ops::findStaff, "/ops/login/code", "operator"))
	.attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
```

### What this does not do

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Store access tokens | No. This ends at "who logged in". To call an external API, keep the token yourself (storage, encryption, revocation and incremental consent all come with it) |
| Make jimble an authorization server | Not offered |
| Register the routes for you | No. You write `get("/auth/google", ...)` yourself ([Principles](./principles)) |

## Two-factor authentication (TOTP)

Once the password is right, **hold the login back** and ask for the code.

```java
// after the password checks out
if (Mfa.isActive(staff.getLong("id"))) {
	Mfa.pending(context, principal);        // not logged in; just parked in the session
	context.response().redirect("/login/code");
	return;
}

Auth.login(context, principal);
```

```java
// POST /login/code
if (!Mfa.complete(context, request.getString("code"))) {
	context.flash().put("message", "That code is not right");
}

context.response().redirect(Mfa.isPending(context) ? "/login/code" : "/");
```

When `complete` returns true it has **already called `Auth.login`** for you.

> [!TRAP]
> **Until the code is in, they are not logged in.** `Auth.principal(context)` returns
> `Principal.ANONYMOUS` and every route other than `/login/code` refuses them.
>
> Which means **`/login/code` needs `Auth.PUBLIC`** — it is a path people take before they
> are logged in. Do not add `Auth.NO_SESSION`: the half-way user lives in the session.

### Enrolling

```java
Mfa.Enrollment enrollment = Mfa.enroll(staffId, "member1@example.com");

// show enrollment.uri() as a QR code (otpauth://totp/...)
// show enrollment.recoveryCodes() this once and never again
```

**`enroll` alone does not turn it on.** After the code is in their authenticator, take the
digits it shows and call `Mfa.activate(staffId, code)`.

```java
if (!Mfa.activate(staffId, request.getString("code"))) {
	context.flash().put("message", "That code does not match. Try again");
}
```

> [!TRAP]
> **The two steps exist so that nobody gets locked out.** Turning it on at `enroll` time
> means **anyone whose QR scan silently failed can never get back in.**

### Enrolling again (a new phone, say)

**When someone who already has it on calls `enroll` again, their current secret and recovery codes keep working** (since 2.2.4).
The new secret and recovery codes are staged, and **swapped in only when `activate` passes with a code from the new one**.

| | Current setup | New setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| After `enroll` | works | not yet (neither `verify` nor its recovery codes pass) |
| After `activate` passes | stops working (its recovery codes are deleted) | works |

Giving up halfway leaves two-factor auth on. Calling `enroll` again throws the previous staging away and starts over.

> Up to 2.2.3, `enroll` deleted the current setup on the spot. Abandoning it left two-factor auth off,
> and **someone holding a stolen session could turn it off just by opening the enrolment page.**
> The staging columns (`auth_mfa.staged_secret` and friends) are added automatically the first time it is used after upgrading.

### The secret is stored encrypted

**`enroll` throws if `auth.mfa.secret_key` is not configured.**

A TOTP secret is not like a password hash. A hash costs work to break; **a leaked secret
produces valid codes immediately.** Stored in the clear it turns into "we have 2FA, and one
database leak walks through all of it".

> [!TRAP]
> **Do not reuse `cipher.key` for this.** Setting `cipher.*` means
> **`hash.password.encrypt` must be set too, or startup fails.**
>
> An app storing plain BCrypt today that sets `cipher.key` for 2FA and writes
> `encrypt = true` will find **every stored password read as ciphertext, and nobody can
> log in.** All the user sees is "wrong id or password", so there is nothing to trace it
> back from. **That is why the key is separate** — use `auth.mfa.secret_key` for 2FA.

### Recovery codes

Phones get lost. This is the way back.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Where they appear | Only in the return value of `enroll`. **The DB keeps only an HMAC keyed with `auth.mfa.secret_key`** (codes issued up to 2.2.3 are stored as SHA-256 and still work) |
| How many | 10 (`auth.mfa.recovery_codes`) |
| Using one | Type it into the same code box. `verify` tries the authenticator first, then these |
| After use | **It is gone.** Each one works once |
| How many are left | `Mfa.remainingRecoveryCodes(userId)` |

**Running out is not announced.** Whether to show the count is your call.

### Against brute force

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Slowing down | The same `Lockout` machinery (keyed `mfa:<user id>`). **Six digits is a million guesses — unthrottled, a day is enough** |
| The shape | Three free attempts, then 1 → 2 → 4 … seconds, capped at 300. Over the cap the answer is **429** |
| Window | One step either way (`auth.mfa.window`). **Widening it widens the target** — at 10 there are 21 winning codes |
| Reuse | **A code that worked will not work again in its window.** That stops someone reusing one they watched being typed |
| Grace | 300 seconds between the password and the code (`auth.mfa.pending`). After that, **start over** |

### Turning it off

```java
post("/mfa/disable", Mfa2::disable).attribute(Auth.FULL_AUTH, true);
```

> [!TRAP]

### More than one kind of login

If your IDs come from **separate tables** — an operator console and a member admin screen,
say — **pass a realm.** Without one, `staff.id = 1` and `member.id = 1` are treated as
**the same "user 1"**: one enrolling **overwrites the other's secret**, and one's code opens
the other's login.

```java
// operator login
if (Mfa.isActive("operator", staff.id())) {
	Mfa.pending(context, principal, "operator");   // the realm is kept in the session
	context.response().redirect("/ops/login/code");
	return;
}

// POST /ops/login/code — complete() checks against the realm given to pending
Mfa.complete(context, code);

// enrol, activate, turn off, count recovery codes
Mfa.enroll("operator", staff.id(), staff.email());
Mfa.activate("operator", staff.id(), code);
Mfa.disable("operator", staff.id());
Mfa.remainingRecoveryCodes("operator", staff.id());
```

- **`complete()` takes no realm.** It checks against the realm given to `pending` — if the
  side receiving the code could choose, it would open **a way to check against another realm's secret**
- A realm is **letters, digits, `_` and `-`, up to 64 characters**. An empty string means "no realm"
- **Calls without a realm behave exactly as before.** Anyone enrolled before realms existed ends up
  in "no realm" and keeps using the same code (the framework adds the column the first time it is used)
- Brute-force counting (`Lockout`) is per realm too

### What it is, and what it is not

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Scheme | TOTP (RFC 6238 over RFC 4226). HMAC-SHA1, 6 digits, 30 seconds — **the one shape every authenticator app reads** |
| Storage | `auth_mfa` and `auth_mfa_recovery`. **A DB is required** (without one, `enroll` throws) |
| QR images | Not drawn. You get `enrollment.uri()` and render it yourself (no new dependency) |
| SMS / email | No. SIM swaps take SMS codes |
| WebAuthn / passkeys | Not yet |
| "Trusted devices" | No. remember-me is the nearby thing, and **it is a different thing** — that one replaces the password |


A working one is in `examples/approval-auth` — login, code, enrollment and turning it off.

## API tokens (Authorization: Bearer)

**Users can issue API tokens for integrations and scripts** (since 2.4.0).
They are opaque tokens held in the DB (not JWTs: revocable at once, no key management).

```java
before(ApiToken.authenticate(App::findPrincipal));   // before Remember.restore, Csrf::verify and Auth::guard
before(Auth::guard);

path("/api", () -> {
	attribute(ApiToken.ACCEPT, true);                 // only routes that declare it accept tokens
	get("/requests", Api::list).attribute(ApiToken.SCOPE, "requests:read");
	post("/requests", Api::create).attribute(ApiToken.SCOPE, "requests:write");
});
```

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer jbt_..." https://example.com/api/requests
```

### Issuing, listing, revoking

```java
// From a page for a user who just entered their password (a FULL_AUTH route)
ApiToken.Issued issued = ApiToken.issue(me.id(), "Expense integration", Set.of("requests:read"), Duration.ofDays(90));
// show issued.token() this one time only; the DB keeps only a hash

List<Data> tokens = ApiToken.list("", me.id());     // id, name, scopes, created_at, expires_at, last_used_at (never the token)
ApiToken.revoke("", me.id(), id);                   // unusable at once; never revokes someone else's
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Format | `jbt_` + 256 random bits. The fixed prefix lets leak scanners (GitHub secret scanning and the like) find it |
| Expiry | Set at issue time (`Duration.ZERO` means none; not recommended) |
| Scopes | Lowercase letters, digits and `: . _ -`. A route's `ApiToken.SCOPE` missing from the token gives **403** |
| Storage | The `auth_api_token` table (SHA-256 only). **Needs a DB** |

### A user who came in with a token

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Login | Logged in **for that request only**. No session cookie is issued |
| Roles | `Auth.ROLE` works as usual (the current role `lookup` returned) |
| `Auth.FULL_AUTH` | **No entry** (401). Changing the password or deleting the account is not done with a token |
| Scopes | Read them with `ApiToken.scopes(context)`. **Scopes do not apply to users who came in with a session** |
| CSRF | `Csrf.verify` skips it (browsers never add Authorization on their own, so another site cannot send it) |

### When it refuses

| | Status |
| --- | --- |
| A Bearer on a route without `ApiToken.ACCEPT` | 401 |
| A wrong, expired or revoked token | 401 (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`) |
| **After `Auth.revoke` / `Auth.revokeOthers`** (tokens issued before it) | 401. Checked with the same generation as sessions, so it stops the moment you lock someone out or they change their password |
| `lookup` returned null (user disabled or deleted) | 401 |
| Missing scope | 403 (`error="insufficient_scope"`) |

> [!TRAP]
> **Put `ApiToken.authenticate` first among the befores.** If the session was read earlier, a token request
> would get a session cookie, so it throws to tell you. If you forget it and a Bearer arrives, Auth.guard warns once.
>
> **Issue tokens from a route with `Auth.FULL_AUTH`**, so someone holding a stolen session cannot mint one.

## Passkeys (passwordless login)

**A passkey alone logs you in** (since 2.4.0). No login id either: the browser offers the passkeys it has for this site.
A passkey includes on-device user verification (fingerprint, face, PIN), so a user who passes is logged in with `Auth.login`.
**No two-factor code is asked for** (the passkey already covers "a device you have" and "verifying it is you"), and `Auth.FULL_AUTH` routes are open to them.

```java
// Registration (a logged-in user who just re-entered their password)
post("/passkey/register/options", c -> c.response().json(Passkey.registrationOptions(c, loginIdOf(c))))
	.attribute(Auth.FULL_AUTH, true);
post("/passkey/register", c -> {
	Passkey.register(c, c.request().bodyJson(), "Laptop");   // the third argument is a name the user recognises
	c.response().json("ok", true);
}).attribute(Auth.FULL_AUTH, true);

// Login (anyone; do not add NO_SESSION)
post("/passkey/login/options", c -> c.response().json(Passkey.loginOptions(c))).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
post("/passkey/login", c -> {
	if (!Passkey.login(c, c.request().bodyJson(), App::findPrincipal)) {   // user id -> Principal (null to refuse)
		throw new HttpException(401, "Could not log in with the passkey");
	}
	c.response().json("ok", true);
}).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);

// The browser-side JS
get("/passkey.js", Passkey.script()).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
```

On the browser side, load the bundled JS and call it.

```html
<script src="/passkey.js"></script>
<script>
	// Register
	await JimblePasskey.register("/passkey/register/options", "/passkey/register", { csrfToken });

	// Log in (on a button)
	await JimblePasskey.login("/passkey/login/options", "/passkey/login", { csrfToken });
	location.href = "/";

	// Offer passkeys in the field's autofill (put an <input autocomplete="username webauthn"> on the page)
	JimblePasskey.login("/passkey/login/options", "/passkey/login", { csrfToken, conditional: true })
		.then(result => { if (result) location.href = "/"; });
</script>
```

Failures throw an `Error` (`error.status` holds the server's status code; a user cancelling gives `error.name === "NotAllowedError"`).
Send extra fields with the verification (a label, say) via `extra: { label: "Laptop" }`, and pass a `signal` (`AbortController`) to stop a pending autofill request when a button is pressed.
A working example is `login.jte` and `passkeys.jte` in examples/approval-auth.
If `csrf.bind_session = true` rotates the token at login, the JS reads `X-CSRF-Token` and swaps it in (you get it via `onCsrfToken`).

### Settings

```conf
auth {
	passkey {
		rp_id   = "example.com"             # the domain passkeys are bound to (required)
		rp_name = "Approval workflow"       # the name the browser shows at registration (empty means rp_id)
		origins = ["https://example.com"]   # accepted origins (empty means https:// + rp_id)
		timeout = 5m                         # from start to finish
	}
}
```

> [!TRAP]
> **Changing `rp_id` later makes every registered passkey unusable**, because passkeys are bound to the domain.
> If you run on subdomains, write the parent domain (`example.com`) and passkeys work from both `app.example.com` and `admin.example.com`.
>
> To try it locally, use `rp_id = "localhost"` and `origins = ["http://localhost:9000"]` (browsers allow plain http for localhost only).

### When each client has its own domain (SaaS)

**`rp_id` can be passed in the route instead of coming from the settings.** Build a `PasskeyRp` and pass the same one to all four methods.

```java
PasskeyRp rp(WebContext c) {
	// Look it up in your client table. Never use the Host header as rp_id directly (unknown domains get 404)
	Tenant tenant = Tenants.byHost(c.request().host()).orElseThrow(() -> new HttpException(404, "Not found"));
	return PasskeyRp.of(tenant.domain(), tenant.name());          // the origin is https://<domain>
}

post("/passkey/login/options", c -> c.response().json(Passkey.loginOptions(c, rp(c)))).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
post("/passkey/login", c -> {
	if (!Passkey.login(c, rp(c), c.request().bodyJson(), App::findPrincipal)) {
		throw new HttpException(401, "Could not log in with the passkey");
	}
	c.response().json("ok", true);
}).attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);
// Registration too: Passkey.registrationOptions(c, rp(c), name) / Passkey.register(c, rp(c), credential, label)
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Separation | Passkeys are kept per rp_id. **A passkey registered for client A does not work for client B** (jimble refuses it by the table's rp_id, and authenticators keep separate keys per rp_id anyway) |
| Wiring mistakes | The rp_id the options were issued for is kept in the session; a different one at verification is refused (start over) |
| Format checks | `PasskeyRp` checks at construction that rp_id is a domain and each origin's host is rp_id or a subdomain of it (http only for localhost). Listing another client's domain throws |
| Listing | `Passkey.list(realm, rp, id)` gives just that client's. `Passkey.list(id)` returns every client's (with `rp_id`) |

> If a client has both a custom domain (`login.client-a.co.jp`) and a shared subdomain (`client-a.saas.example`),
> a passkey is bound to only one rp_id. Decide first which domain serves the login page.

### What is checked

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Challenge | Kept in the session and **usable once**. Refused after `timeout`. A registration challenge only works for the user who was logged in when it was issued |
| Origin | Anything not in `origins` is refused, and so are calls from inside another site's iframe (`crossOrigin`) |
| User verification | **On-device user verification (UV) is always required.** A security key that was only touched (UP) does not pass |
| Signature | Verified with the registered public key (ES256 / EdDSA / RS256, all with the JDK alone) |
| User | The user handle the browser returns must match the registered one |
| Cloning | A signature counter that went backwards is refused (synced passkeys always report 0, and then it is not checked) |

**Authenticator attestation is not verified** (`attestation: "none"`). Most passkeys send none, and ordinary apps
have no reason to refuse an authenticator by its maker.

### Listing and deleting

```java
List<Data> passkeys = Passkey.list(me.id());          // id, rp_id, label, created_at, last_used_at, backed_up
Passkey.delete(me.id(), id);                           // from a FULL_AUTH route; never deletes someone else's
Passkey.deleteAll("", me.id());                        // account deletion, etc.
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Storage | The `auth_passkey` table. **Needs a DB and sessions**. Used challenges are kept in `auth_passkey_challenge` and never accepted twice (since 2.5.2; so a captured request cannot be replayed with cookie sessions) |
| Realms | Split by the route's `Auth.REALM` (registration and login use the route's realm; listing and deleting also take a realm) |
| A lost device | Have the user log in another way (a password, say) and remove it with `Passkey.delete`. `Auth.revoke` only stops current sessions; the passkey stays |

> [!TRAP]
> **Register from a route with `Auth.FULL_AUTH`.** Someone holding a stolen session who adds their own passkey
> keeps getting in with it even after the password is changed.
>
> **Put a rate limit on the passkey login endpoints** (`RateLimit`). Guessing does not work, but every issued challenge creates a session.

## Basic auth

Operational endpoints can use Basic auth
([Requests and responses](./request-response)).

```java
path("/ops", () -> {
	before(BasicAuth.of("ops", System.getenv("OPS_PASSWORD")));
	attribute(Auth.PUBLIC, true);      // a different mechanism from the session login
	get("/whoami", Ops::whoami);
});
```

## What this does not do

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Annotations (`@PreAuthorize` and friends) | Not used, per the [principles](./principles). Routes declare it as an attribute |
| Showing the user how many days are left | Not offered. Read the row yourself |
| JWT | **Deliberately not offered.** You cannot revoke one, and it adds key management. For API auth, use the opaque DB-held tokens above (API tokens) |
| SAML | Not yet |
| A permission table | Roles are plain strings |

A working one is in `examples/approval-auth`.
