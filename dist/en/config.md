# Configuration

You write it in `conf/application.conf`. The format is HOCON.

## Where it lives

**Configuration goes in `conf/`.**

```
conf/application.conf          configuration
conf/application.local.conf    per environment
conf/migration/<schema name>/  migrations
```

Add `conf` to your resources in `build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
sourceSets {
	main {
		resources {
			srcDir("conf")
		}
	}
}
```

Now **everything under `conf/` goes into the jar as it is.**
`codegen`, `migrate`, `jimbleRun` and your tests all see the same files, from the
classpath.

**jimble reads the classpath and nothing else.** It does not look outside the jar.
Change the configuration and you rebuild. **The running jar and its configuration
are one to one.**

**It reads exactly one file.**

1. `application.<env>.conf` if it exists — **that one**
2. Otherwise `application.conf`

**The startup log says which file it read.**

```
設定: jar:file:/opt/app/app.jar!/application.prod.conf
```

## Switching by environment

What pulls in the shared file is **the `include` in the per-environment file.**

```conf
# application.prod.conf
include "application.conf"

db {
	main {
		url = ${?DB_URL}
	}
}
```

```
application.conf          shared
application.prod.conf     production. line 1 reads the shared file, the rest overrides it
```

The environment comes from `-Djimble.env=prod`. The default is `local`.

**jimble does not add the shared file behind your back.** If it did, **you could
not tell from the file** whether the `include` is doing the work or the framework
is. One file is read, and what follows is what is written there.

### If you forget the include

The entire shared configuration drops out. When it does, startup names what is
missing.

```
設定: application.conf にしかないキーが読まれていません: cipher, session, server
 / application.prod.conf の先頭に include "application.conf" を書いてください
```

> In English: keys that exist only in application.conf are not being read — cipher,
> session, server. Put `include "application.conf"` at the top of application.prod.conf.

## Do not write secrets in the file

```conf
db {
	main_db {
		url      = "jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/app"
		url      = ${?DB_URL}
		password = ""
		password = ${?DB_PASSWORD}
	}
}
```

`${?ENV_NAME}` means "override if the environment variable is there, otherwise
leave the line above alone". Writing the same key twice is the correct way to do
this.

## Comments are # or //

**HOCON has no `/* */`.** Write one and you get this.

```
Key '/' may not be followed by token: '*'
```

## Every key

**Everything jimble reads is here.** A key that is not in this list is a key jimble does
not read — a typo is silently ignored. The values shown are the **defaults**, so leave out
anything you are not changing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Durations and sizes carry their unit in the value** (`30m`, `200ms`, `10MiB`).
> **A bare number fails at startup** — that is what stops `assets.max_age = 3600000` from
> going through as forty-one days. The units are `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`
> and `B`, `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`.

> [!TRAP]
> **`MB` is a power of 1000 and `MiB` a power of 1024** (HOCON's rule).
> `10MB` is 10,000,000 bytes; `10MiB` is 10,485,760.
> **What you write is what you get** — either is fine, but they are not the same number
> when you compare against a default.

```

## `cipher.key` and `auth.mfa.secret_key` are different keys

**Do not reuse `cipher.key` for two-factor auth.**

**If you set `cipher.*`, you must also set `hash.password.encrypt`.** Leave it out and
startup fails.

The default used to be "true if `cipher.key` *and* `cipher.iv` are both set". So an app
that added only `cipher.key` stayed at false and **flipped the moment `cipher.iv` was
added** — stored BCrypt hashes were then read as encrypted and **everyone was locked
out**. All it says is "wrong id or password", so nothing points back at the setting that
was added.

**No default is decided by a distant key.** If you want encryption, say so.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `cipher.key` / `cipher.iv` | Reads the **already-encrypted password hashes of a migrated app**. Not for anything new — fixed IV, no tamper detection |
| `auth.mfa.secret_key` | Encrypts **TOTP secrets**. AES-256-GCM |

An app with no `cipher.*` at all needs no setting, exactly as before (BCrypt only, no
encryption).

## trust_proxy is false by default

Set it to `true` and `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted.
**Leave it `false` until the application sits behind a load balancer.**
Turn it on while the application can still be reached directly and anyone can
forge their source IP.

## cookie.secure is true by default

The default is the safe side, but local development is http, so the browser never
sends the cookie back. Session, CSRF and flash all stop working, and nothing
raises an error.

When `env=local` and `secure = true`, startup logs a WARN.
Put `cookie { secure = false }` in your local `application.conf`, and
**take it out when you ship to production**.

## Check it in the startup log

```
jimble 構成: env=local / session=none / cache=db / redis=なし / db=[blog_example]
```

The configuration that was loaded appears on the first line at startup.
"I thought I configured that" gets caught right here.
