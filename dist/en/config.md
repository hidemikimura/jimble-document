# Configuration

You write it in `conf/application.conf`. The format is HOCON.

## Where it lives

**Configuration goes in `conf/`.**

```
conf/application.conf          configuration
conf/application.local.conf    per environment
conf/migration/<schema name>/  migrations
```

Add `conf` to your resources in `build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
sourceSets {
	main {
		resources {
			srcDir("conf")
		}
	}
}
```

Now **everything under `conf/` goes into the jar as it is.**
`codegen`, `migrate`, `jimbleRun` and your tests all see the same files, from the
classpath.

**jimble reads the classpath and nothing else.** It does not look outside the jar.
Change the configuration and you rebuild. **The running jar and its configuration
are one to one.**

**It reads exactly one file.**

1. `application.<env>.conf` if it exists — **that one**
2. Otherwise `application.conf`

**The startup log says which file it read.**

```
設定: jar:file:/opt/app/app.jar!/application.prod.conf
```

## Switching by environment

What pulls in the shared file is **the `include` in the per-environment file.**

```conf
# application.prod.conf
include "application.conf"

db {
	main {
		url = ${?DB_URL}
	}
}
```

```
application.conf          shared
application.prod.conf     production. line 1 reads the shared file, the rest overrides it
```

The environment comes from `-Djimble.env=prod`. The default is `local`.

**jimble does not add the shared file behind your back.** If it did, **you could
not tell from the file** whether the `include` is doing the work or the framework
is. One file is read, and what follows is what is written there.

### If you forget the include

The entire shared configuration drops out. When it does, startup names what is
missing.

```
設定: application.conf にしかないキーが読まれていません: cipher, session, server
 / application.prod.conf の先頭に include "application.conf" を書いてください
```

> In English: keys that exist only in application.conf are not being read — cipher,
> session, server. Put `include "application.conf"` at the top of application.prod.conf.

## Do not write secrets in the file

```conf
db {
	main_db {
		url      = "jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/app"
		url      = ${?DB_URL}
		password = ""
		password = ${?DB_PASSWORD}
	}
}
```

`${?ENV_NAME}` means "override if the environment variable is there, otherwise
leave the line above alone". Writing the same key twice is the correct way to do
this.

## Comments are # or //

**HOCON has no `/* */`.** Write one and you get this.

```
Key '/' may not be followed by token: '*'
```

## The main keys

	host        = ""         # the address to listen on. empty means all of them

## `cipher.key` and `auth.mfa.secret_key` are different keys

**Do not reuse `cipher.key` for two-factor auth.**

The default of `hash.password.encrypt` is **"true if `cipher.key` is set"**. A migrated
app's stored hashes are encrypted, so **having the key but checking against plain BCrypt
would lock everyone out** — that default exists to prevent it.

Which means an app storing plain BCrypt today that adds `cipher.key` **to get 2FA locks
everyone out the other way.** All it says is "wrong id or password", so nothing points back
at the setting that was added.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `cipher.key` / `cipher.iv` | Reads the **already-encrypted password hashes of a migrated app**. Not for anything new — fixed IV, no tamper detection |
| `auth.mfa.secret_key` | Encrypts **TOTP secrets**. AES-256-GCM |

Set `hash.password.encrypt` explicitly to say which you mean (**an explicit value wins over
the default**).

## trust_proxy is false by default

Set it to `true` and `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted.
**Leave it `false` until the application sits behind a load balancer.**
Turn it on while the application can still be reached directly and anyone can
forge their source IP.

## cookie.secure is true by default

The default is the safe side, but local development is http, so the browser never
sends the cookie back. Session, CSRF and flash all stop working, and nothing
raises an error.

When `env=local` and `secure = true`, startup logs a WARN.
Put `cookie { secure = false }` in your local `application.conf`, and
**take it out when you ship to production**.

## Check it in the startup log

```
jimble 構成: env=local / session=none / cache=db / redis=なし / db=[blog_example]
```

The configuration that was loaded appears on the first line at startup.
"I thought I configured that" gets caught right here.
