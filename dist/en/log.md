## Logger names

| Logger | What comes out of it |
| --- | --- |
| `access` | The access log (one line per request) |
| `access.bot` | The bot access log |
| `error` | `Log.error(...)` |
| `io.jimble.util.log.Log` | `Log.info` / `warn` / `debug` / `trace` |
| Any name you like | Chosen with `Log.appInfo("my.audit", ...)` and friends |

> [!TRAP]
> **The class that called `Log.info` and the rest does not become the logger name.**
> It is always `io.jimble.util.log.Log`.
> To split by purpose, use `Log.appInfo("a name", ...)`.

## What is in every log line, always

| Key | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `request_id` | The execution ID (`-` outside a request) |
| `sql_execute_count` | How many SQL statements this request issued |
| `sql_execute_time` | Their total time (milliseconds) |
| `local_info` | **The server's own** IP and host name |

The point is that **the SQL count and time are in every log line.**
N+1 is built to be something "you can see in the log" (requirement NF-O-02).

## The access log

**One line per request**, written at the end of it. **It is written even when no route matched** (404s are kept too).

| Key | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `method` / `path` / `query` | The request |
| `status` | The status code |
| `elapsed` | How long it took (milliseconds) |
| `matched` | Whether a route matched |
| `bot` | Whether it was judged a bot |

```json
{"logger_name":"access","level":"INFO","message":"GET /users/42 200",
 "request_id":"m1abcd-xyz-1","sql_execute_count":2,"sql_execute_time":4.0,
 "method":"GET","path":"/users/42","query":"","status":200,"elapsed":12.34,
 "matched":true,"bot":false}
```

> [!TRAP]
> **The client's IP and User-Agent are not in there.** `local_info` is the server's own.
> If you need them, add them with `Log.addFieldProvider(...)`.

### Splitting out the bots

With `server.bot_access_log` (default `true`) on, bot lines go to **`access.bot`**.
The judgement is a match against a User-Agent list (`crawler-user-agents`).

> [!TIP]
> Crawlers can be a sizeable share of the total. Split them out and
> **you can count human traffic on its own.** Set it to `false` to keep them together.

### Turning it off

`server.access_log = false` stops it writing anything at all.

```conf
server {
	access_log = false
}
```

**This is the largest single piece of a request** (about 40% of what it allocates — around 3,400 bytes).
Turning it off stops both the work of building the line and the bot judgement
(matching the User-Agent). Requests per second move by around 10%
(52,537 → 57,030 on a 10-core Mac at 8 connections).
**That figure varies by machine, so measure it on yours before turning it off**
(`jimble-load/load.sh` measures the two side by side).

**Metrics and tracing stay.** The access log is the only thing that goes.

> [!TRAP]
> **Leave the default at `true`.** With it off,
> **you have no way to find out afterwards what happened.**
> Neither the 500s nor who hit which path are kept.
> Turn it off only when something in front of you (a load balancer, nginx)
> already keeps the same thing, **and** you have measured and found it isn't enough.

## The execution ID

It is `base-36 time-random-sequence`, and one is issued per request (and per WebSocket message, and per batch).
It is carried around in a `ScopedValue` — **MDC is not used.**

The time comes first, so **sorting the IDs sorts them by time.**

> [!NOTE]
> **It is not put in the response headers.**
> To make "find me the log for the error on this screen" work,
> write `context.response().setResponseHeader("X-Request-Id", context.executionId())` yourself in an `after`.

## SQL logging

The **count and time** of SQL statements are tallied automatically (the table above).

> [!WARN]
> **The SQL text itself and the bind values are not logged.**
> There is no slow-query threshold either.
> When you want them, look on the DB side (`general_log` / `slow_query_log`).

Set `log.db = true` and whatever the app writes with `DBLog.save(db, data)` goes into
the `db_log` table. **It is not a feature that records SQL automatically.**

## Configuring logback

jimble carries logback and the encoders, but **the configuration file is the app's.**
The `jimble new` skeleton creates `conf/logback.xml` (`conf/` goes into the jar).

```xml
<configuration>

	<!-- The form people read -->
	<appender name="console" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
		<encoder>
			<pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{20} - %msg%n</pattern>
			<charset>UTF-8</charset>
		</encoder>
	</appender>

	<!-- Exceptions. Prints the stack trace indented (bundled with jimble) -->
	<appender name="error" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
		<target>System.err</target>
		<encoder class="io.jimble.util.log.encoder.LogbackErrorEncoder"/>
	</appender>

	<!-- The form machines read. One JSON object per line (bundled with jimble) -->
	<appender name="json" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
		<encoder class="io.jimble.util.log.encoder.LogbackJsonEncoder"/>
	</appender>

	<logger name="access" level="INFO" additivity="false">
		<appender-ref ref="json"/>
	</logger>

	<logger name="access.bot" level="INFO" additivity="false">
		<appender-ref ref="json"/>
	</logger>

	<logger name="error" level="ERROR" additivity="false">
		<appender-ref ref="error"/>
	</logger>

	<root level="INFO">
		<appender-ref ref="console"/>
	</root>

</configuration>
```

> [!TRAP]
> **`access.bot` is a child of `access`.** Drop the `additivity="false"` and
> the bot lines go to **both** (you double-count while thinking you are counting humans).

> [!WARN]
> Leave the configuration file out and you get logback's defaults, where
> **the access log and the app's own logs land in the same place, mixed together.**

To split by environment, pass `-Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.prod.xml`
instead of using `logback.xml`.

## Catching it in tests

```java
@BeforeEach
void captureLog () {

	Log.sink((loggerName, level, message, data, throwable) ->
		logs.add(new Entry(loggerName, level, message, data)));

}

@AfterEach
void restoreLog () {

	Log.resetSink();

	// 設定を触るテストがあるので、必ず戻す（残すと後ろのテストが理由なく落ちる）
	Conf.reload();

}
```

`Log.sink(...)` **replaces the whole thing**. Do not forget `Log.resetSink()` in `@AfterEach`.

## Metrics

`Metrics.snapshot()` returns everything it has right now.

```java
get("/metrics", context -> context.response().json(Metrics.snapshot()));
```

> [!WARN]
> **jimble does not register a `/metrics` route for you.** Whether to expose it, and behind what
> authentication, is the application's call — if the framework owned the route you could not close it
> when you needed to (same reasoning as [the health check](./server)).
> The one-liner above is **readable by anyone**; put it behind your network or your auth.

The shape:

```json
{
  "counter": { "http.request": 1234, "http.status.2xx": 1230, "http.status.5xx": 4 },
  "latency": {
    "http.GET /posts/{id}": {
      "count": 1200, "sum_ms": 4321.0, "max_ms": 812.3,
      "p50_ms": 10, "p95_ms": 100, "p99_ms": 500,
      "bucket": { "1": 300, "5": 700, "10": 150, "50": 40, "100": 8, "500": 1, "1000": 1, "5000": 0, "over": 0 }
    }
  },
  "gauge": { "db.pool.main.active": 3, "db.pool.main.idle": 5 }
}
```

### What you get without asking

| Name | What |
| --- | --- |
| `http.request` | Request count |
| `http.status.2xx` … `5xx` | Count per status class |
| `http.GET /posts/{id}` | Latency distribution per route |
| `db.pool.<name>.{active,idle,total,waiting}` | Connection pool usage |
| `mq.<queue>.received` / `.completed` / `.error` … | MQ counts, by how the message ended |
| `mq.<queue>` | MQ latency distribution |

### Adding your own

```java
Metrics.count("posts.created");
Metrics.record("search.elapsed", elapsedNanos);
Metrics.gauge("cache.size", () -> cache.size());
```

> [!TRAP]
> **What you pass to `Metrics.gauge(...)` must not do I/O.** It is called on every
> `Metrics.snapshot()`, so if it touches the database you **lose your metrics exactly when the
> database is congested** — which is when you want them most. That is why jimble does not register
> the MQ backlog (`MqQueue#pendingCount()`) for you. Register it yourself if you want it anyway:
>
> ```java
> Metrics.gauge("mq.notice.pending", () -> noticeQueue.pendingCount());
> ```

> [!WARN]
> **Never build a name out of user input.** `Metrics.count(request.path())` fills the heap as soon as
> someone hits `/aaa`, `/aab`, … There is a cap of **1000 names**; past it jimble warns once and stops
> counting — and **your real routes stop being counted too**. That is also why jimble keys latency on
> `GET /posts/{id}` rather than the raw path, and collapses everything unmatched into `(unmatched)`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Distributions are fixed buckets** (1 / 5 / 10 / 50 / 100 / 500 / 1000 / 5000ms, plus an overflow
> bucket) — individual samples are never stored. Memory does not grow with the number of samples, but
> **a percentile can only name the bucket's upper bound** (`p95_ms: 100` means "100ms or less").
> Samples in the overflow bucket report the observed maximum instead.

> [!NOTE]
> `Metrics.reset()` is **for tests**. Calling it in a running application throws away everything counted so far.

## Tracing

Follow one request across services (requirement NF-O-05). **You only pay for it if you use it.**

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.jimble:jimble-otel:0.2.1")
```

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {

    JimbleOtel.install("my-app", "http://localhost:4318");

    new JimbleServer(...).start();

}
```

That is all. Spans then appear for:

| Span | Name | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An HTTP request | `GET /posts/{id}` | `server` |
| One SQL statement | `SELECT post` | `client` |
| Putting a message on a queue | `mq.put notice` | `producer` |
| Handling a queued message | `mq notice` | `consumer` |
| One batch run | `batch daily-rollup` | `internal` |

Add your own wherever you want more detail.

```java
try (Span span = Tracing.start("convert image", SpanKind.internal)) {
    span.attribute("file", name);
    convert(file);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **An application that does not add it grows by zero bytes.** `jimble-core` carries only the
> interfaces (`Tracer` / `Span`); the OpenTelemetry implementation lives in `jimble-otel`. While
> nothing is registered, `Tracing.start(...)` costs **one static read and a branch** — measured at
> 0 bytes allocated per call.

### Across services

An incoming `traceparent` (W3C Trace Context) is **picked up automatically**, and jimble's HTTP
client **adds it automatically** on the way out.

```java
// the other side's trace continues yours
new HttpGetExecutor("https://api.example.com/users").execute();
```

MQ is linked too. **The request that queued the message and the process that handled it minutes
later end up on the same trace.** The `traceparent` is kept in its own column on the queue table —
never inside `data`.

> [!WARN]
> **Applications using MQ get one extra column on the queue table** (`traceparent varchar(64)`).
> `MqTables.install(...)` applies it at startup; there is nothing to run by hand.

For any other way of reaching out, pass it yourself.

```java
String traceparent = Tracing.traceparent();   // null when tracing is off
```

### Joining logs to traces

While tracing is on, **every log line carries `trace_id` and `span_id`**. The execution ID
(`request_id`) is unchanged, so anything already parsing your logs keeps working.

```json
{"request_id":"mttvgm93-10676dj-1","trace_id":"4bf92f35...","span_id":"00f067aa...", ...}
```

### Sampling

At volume your backend will not keep up. Pass a ratio.

```java
JimbleOtel.install("my-app", "http://localhost:4318", 0.1);   // one in ten
```

> [!NOTE]
> **The decision is made per trace**, so you never get a trace with the middle missing.

### Where it goes

OTLP over HTTP (`/v1/traces`), protobuf encoded. An OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, Grafana
Tempo — anything that speaks OTLP will do.

> [!TRAP]
> **Forgetting `/v1/traces` still works** — jimble appends it. Without that, the endpoint just
> answers 404 and **nothing arrives, with nothing in the log to tell you**.

> [!NOTE]
> Sending uses the **JDK `HttpClient`**. OpenTelemetry's default (okhttp) drags in okhttp 851KB +
> okio 374KB + kotlin-stdlib 1.7MB, so it is excluded. Adding `jimble-otel` costs **0.9MB**.

### Writing your own destination

`Tracer` is a two-method interface. Write one to print to stdout, to feed an in-house system, or to
inspect spans in a test. A `RecordingTracer` for tests ships in `jimble-core`.

```java
RecordingTracer tracer = new RecordingTracer();
Tracing.use(tracer);

// ... the code under test ...

assertEquals("GET /posts/{id}", tracer.spans().get(0).name());
```

## Configuration keys

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `server.access_log` | `true` | Writes the access log. `false` writes nothing at all |
| `server.bot_access_log` | `true` | Splits the bot access log out into `access.bot` |
| `log.db` | `false` | Enables `DBLog.save(...)` |

> [!NOTE]
> **There are no configuration keys for log level, destination, or format.** That is `logback.xml`'s job.
