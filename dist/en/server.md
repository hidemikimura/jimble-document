# Server configuration

```conf
server {
	host                 = ""         # Address to listen on. Empty means all of them
	port                 = 9000
	max_request_size     = 10485760   # Limit on the request body (10MiB)

	shutdown_grace   = 0s      # From "start stopping" to refusing new requests (seconds)
	shutdown_timeout = 15s     # How long to wait for in-flight work (seconds)

	backlog            = 1024  # Connections the OS holds while accept catches up

}
```

## Accepting connections and writing responses

**`backlog`** is the number of connections **the OS holds for you** while accept catches up.
Past that, **the OS turns callers away** — it never reaches the application, so
**not a single line appears in your log**.
Raise it for bursty traffic (just after a restart, a campaign, a wave of reconnects);
**it does not make anything faster**. It only lets the backlog wait instead of being refused.

> [!NOTE]
> **The OS has its own ceiling** (`somaxconn` on Linux).
> Raising this does nothing if that one is lower.

**`write_queue_length`** is the length of the queue responses are written through.
**At 0 or 1 there is no queue** and the response is written inline (the default).
At 2 or more, another thread does the writing, so **your handler can move on while a slow
client is still being written to**. What is queued **sits in memory**, though — a bigger
queue is not a faster server.

**`smart_async_writes`** chooses, when there is a queue, between "always queue" and
"**write inline while the queue is idle, switch to queueing when it gets busy**".

> [!WARN]
> **`smart_async_writes` does nothing on its own.**
> Helidon does not read it unless `write_queue_length` is **2 or more** (there is no queue otherwise).
> **Leaving `write_queue_length` at 0 or 1 while setting `smart_async_writes = true` fails at startup** —
> silently ignoring it would leave you with a setting that "is on but changes nothing".

The startup log says which one was chosen.

```
サーバー設定（接続）: 接続待ち=1024 / 書き出し列=作らない（その場で書く）
サーバー設定（接続）: 接続待ち=1024 / 書き出し列=32（空いていればその場で書く）
```

**Write nothing and you get the defaults above.** What is actually in effect is printed in the startup log.

```
jimble を起動しました: http://localhost:9000
サーバー設定: 待受=全部 / 本文上限=10485760byte / ヘッダ上限=16384byte / アイドル=60秒 / 圧縮=true / プロキシ信頼=false
```

## Port

**The port, and only the port, can also be given as a system property.** That is so a container can change the port without touching the configuration file.

```bash
java -Djimble.server.port=8080 -jar app.jar
```

The order of precedence is `-Djimble.server.port` &gt; `server.port` &gt; 9000.

> [!TIP]
> `JimbleServer.start(app, 0)` **takes a free port automatically.**
> Use this in tests (pin the port and they fail only when you run them side by side).
> The port it actually took comes back from `server.port()`.

## The listen address

**Empty means it listens on every address.** Narrow it down for anything that must not be visible from outside.

```conf
server { host = "127.0.0.1" }
```

> [!TIP]
> An MCP server you run on your own machine needs this ([MCP](./mcp)).
> **Lean on the firewall instead, and the day someone forgets to configure it you are silently public.**

## Limits

| | Limit | When it is exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request body | `server.max_request_size` (10MiB) | **413** |
| Headers as a whole | `server.max_header_size` (16KiB) | the connection is cut |
| A connection doing nothing | `server.idle_timeout` (60 seconds) | closed |

Uploads have a separate limit of their own ([File upload](./upload)).

> [!WARN]
> **`upload.max_total_size` larger than `server.max_request_size` fails at startup**
> — the body is cut here first, so the larger limit could never be reached.
> Raise both if you are going to accept large things (both default to 10MiB).

There are no read or write timeouts.

## Behind a proxy

**By default `X-Forwarded-*` is not believed.** You start believing it once you know for certain that every request comes through the proxy in front.

```conf
server { trust_proxy = true }
```

With `true`, `proxyAddress()` returns the source in this order.

1. `CF-Connecting-IP`
2. `X-Real-IP`
3. the **first** entry in `X-Forwarded-For`
4. the connection source, if none of those are there

> [!TRAP]
> **Setting `trust_proxy` to true does not change `address()`.**
> `address()` is always the **TCP connection source** (= the load balancer).
> Use `proxyAddress()` anywhere you decide something from the source address.

> [!TRAP]
> **Bot detection (`isBotAccess()`) looks at `address()`.**
> Behind a proxy, the IP it judges on is the load balancer's.

> [!TRAP]
> **`scheme()` does not look at `X-Forwarded-Proto` either.**
> Terminate TLS in front and the app sees `http`.
> Watch for that when you build a redirect target.

> [!WARN]
> **Do not set `true` while the server can still be reached directly.**
> Anyone can attach those headers, so **the source address can be forged at will.**
> There is no mechanism for restricting trusted upstreams by IP (it is a single boolean).

## Compression

`server.compression` (default `true`) turns it **on / off**.
What gets compressed is the server's (Helidon's) decision, from `Accept-Encoding`.

> [!NOTE]
> **There is no compression level and no per-type exclusion.** Do the fine-grained control in front of jimble.

## Blocking bots

If you only need to tell them apart, splitting the access log is enough ([Logging](./log)). To **block** them, declare it.

```java
before(BotBlocker.forbidden());                          // return 403
before(BotBlocker.of(context -> context.response().redirect("/")));   // return whatever you like
```

> [!NOTE]
> **There is no default "block" behaviour.** Blocking the search engines too would hurt,
> so what to return is left to the app.

## What is not here

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **TLS / HTTPS** | Terminate it in front (load balancer, nginx) |
| **HTTP/2** | Not in the dependencies |
| **A health check route** | jimble does not provide one (see "Stopping" below) |

## Stopping

**It does not stop dead.** `stop()` goes in this order.

1. **Mark itself as stopping** — `Shutdown.isStopping()` becomes true. **Ordinary requests are still served**
2. Wait `server.shutdown_grace` (default 0)
3. **Refuse new requests** (503)
4. Wait for the in-flight ones to finish, up to `server.shutdown_timeout` (default 15 seconds)
5. Stop the server

**On SIGTERM this runs by itself** (that is what a container sends, and then it waits).

### Take the health check down first

jimble does not provide a health check route. **Write it like this.**

```java
get("/health_check", context ->
	context.response().send(Shutdown.isStopping() ? 503 : 200));
```

> [!TIP]
> It takes the load balancer a while to pull this machine out of rotation.
> Answer 503 to the requests that arrive in the meantime and **from the outside that is an error.**
> That is why there is room to wait between step 1 and step 3.
> Put in the health check interval × the failure count (2 seconds × 3, say → `shutdown_grace = 10s`).

> [!WARN]
> **If the wait runs out, it stops with work still in flight.**
> When that happens, `処理中のリクエストが N 件残ったまま停止します` goes out at warn.
> Not stopping at all is the worse outcome (the container kills it).

> [!NOTE]
> To have threads you started yourself stop along with it, hand them to `Shutdown.add(...)`
> ([Execution model](./execution)).

### The running marker (`RUNNING_PID_{port}`)

Once it is listening, jimble puts a file named like `RUNNING_PID_8080` in
**the directory that holds the application jar**. Its content is the process ID.
It is removed when `stop()` completes (SIGTERM included).

```bash
kill $(cat /opt/app/RUNNING_PID_8080)   # stop it
test -f /opt/app/RUNNING_PID_8080       # is it running?
```

- The port number is part of the name, so several servers started from the same directory do not erase each other's marker
- **When not running from a jar (`jimbleRun`, tests) nothing is written.** The place is "the jar's directory", and there is no jar to sit next to
- If a marker from the previous run is still there (`kill -9`, power loss), it warns and overwrites. **Startup is not blocked**
- If it cannot be written (read-only directory, for instance) it warns and keeps listening

## Making jimble the proxy

The other way round: jimble can forward on to another server.

```java
install(() -> ReverseProxy.mount("/api", "http://backend:8080"));
```

`X-Forwarded-For` is **appended to the existing value** (not overwritten).
The timeouts are `proxy.connect_timeout` (5 seconds) and `proxy.request_timeout` (30 seconds),
and a forward that fails returns **502**.

### The equivalents of nginx's proxy_set_header and friends

Pass a configured proxy to `mount`. **Finish the configuration before `mount`** (changing it after it has handled a request throws).

```java
install(() -> ReverseProxy.mount("/shop", new ReverseProxy("http://shop:9000")
	.preserveHost()                                     // proxy_set_header Host $http_host
	.setHeader("X-App", "front")                        // proxy_set_header X-App front
	.setHeader("X-User", context -> userId(context))    // value built from the request (null: not sent)
	.removeHeader("Cookie")                             // proxy_set_header Cookie ""
	.hideResponseHeader("X-Powered-By")                 // proxy_hide_header X-Powered-By
	.redirect("http://shop.internal/", "/shop/")        // proxy_redirect http://shop.internal/ /shop/
	.cookieDomain("shop.internal", "example.com")       // proxy_cookie_domain shop.internal example.com
	.cookiePath("/", "/shop/")));                       // proxy_cookie_path / /shop/
```

| | The same defaults as nginx |
| --- | --- |
| `Host` | **The upstream's** is sent (`proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host`). The original `Host` goes in `X-Forwarded-Host` / `X-Forwarded-Port`. If the upstream **routes by host**, add `preserveHost()` |
| `Location` / `Refresh` | **Values starting with the upstream URL are rewritten to the path the browser sees** (`proxy_redirect default`: `http://backend:8080/moved` → `/api/moved`). Relative values (`/moved`) are left alone. Turn it off with `noRedirectRewrite()` |
| Upstream connection | Closed after each request (no keepalive). For `https://` upstreams the certificate's host name is checked |
| Compression | A gzip body from the upstream is passed through as is (not compressed a second time) |
