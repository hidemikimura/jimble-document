# Using the DB

## Configure it

Write your data source in `application.conf`.

```conf
db {
	blog_example {
		main     = true
		driver   = "org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"
		url      = "jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/blog_example?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8"
		url      = ${?DB_URL}
		username = "blog"
		username = ${?DB_USER}
		password = ""
		password = ${?DB_PASSWORD}

		maximumPoolSize      = 10
		connection_pool_type = "hikari"
	}
}

codegen {
	package = "db"
}
```

**Do not put secrets in the file.** Write them as `${?ENV_NAME}` and the
environment variable wins when it is set. When it is not, the value from the
line above stays.

`jimble-db` ships drivers for both MySQL / MariaDB and PostgreSQL, so you
normally do not have to add one.

## Choose a DB product

Set `product` and **the SQL builder emits SQL for that product.**

```conf
db {
	blog_example {
		main     = true
		product  = "postgresql"
		driver   = "org.postgresql.Driver"
		url      = "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/blog_example"
		username = "blog"
		password = "blog"
		password = ${?DB_PASSWORD}
	}
}
```

> [!TRAP]
> **Never write the `${?ENV}` line on its own.** When the variable is not set, **the key
> disappears entirely** (the form above is a pair: a default, then an override). Connect
> to PostgreSQL with the password gone and what comes back is
> `The server requested SCRAM-based authentication, but no password was provided.` —
> **which does not look like a configuration problem at all.**

## When the database does not exist yet

Write `create_database_sql` and it is run **once, after a failed connection**.

```conf
db {
	blog_example {
		...
		create_database_sql = "CREATE DATABASE blog_example"
	}
}
```

Leave it out and nothing happens, so **you do not need it if you created the database by
hand.** In production you normally connect as a user without that privilege, so this is
for development and CI.

| Value you can write | Product |
|---|---|
| `mysql` (default) / `mariadb` | MySQL 8.x / MariaDB |
| `postgresql` / `postgres` / `pgsql` | PostgreSQL 16 and later |

Leave it out and you get `mysql`. Write a value it does not know and
**startup fails**.

**Not one line of your application code changes.**

```java
// This one line becomes
//   MySQL      SELECT `post`.`id` AS `post__id` ... LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
//   PostgreSQL SELECT "post"."id" AS "post__id" ... LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
// depending on product
SQL.select().from(Post.instance()).where(Post.id.eq(1L));
```

Each data source can name a different product (MySQL for the main one,
PostgreSQL for reporting, and so on).

### What you cannot write for a given product

**What you cannot write raises `DialectException` at the point where the SQL is
built.** You never get as far as running it and failing on the product's syntax
error.

| Builder | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|
| `Dsl.match(...)` (full-text search) | Not available. `to_tsvector` tokenizes differently and scores differently, so we do not silently substitute it |
| `Dsl.dateFormat(col, "%Y-%m-%d")` | Not available. `to_char` uses a different format language, so substituting it would return **a different string instead of raising**. Format it on the Java side |
| `Dsl.jsonExtract(col, "$.a[0]")` | Arrays, wildcards and quoted keys are not available. Only the `$.a.b` form |

The other way round, **things that differ only in name we do line up silently**
(`RAND` / `RANDOM`, `IFNULL` / `COALESCE`, `TRUNCATE` / `TRUNC`, and so on).
`Dsl.concat(...)` becomes `||` on PostgreSQL (PostgreSQL's `concat()` swallows
NULL as an empty string, so swapping the name alone would change the result
compared with MySQL).

When you really do want the product's own syntax, `Dsl.freeSql(...)` is the way out.

### Things to watch

- **Spatial functions take their coordinates in a different order.** SRID 4326 on
  MySQL 8 is latitude then longitude; PostGIS is longitude then latitude. jimble
  does not absorb this, so line it up yourself if you use both
- Migration SQL (`conf/migration/...`) **runs exactly as you wrote it.**
  To run on both products, split it **by filename suffix** —
  `001_xxx.mysql.sql` / `001_xxx.postgresql.sql` (no suffix is applied on both).
  See [Splitting SQL per product](./codegen)

## Connecting at startup

**Writing the configuration is not enough.** Call it explicitly from your `main`.

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {

	Migration.install();                                // startup migrations (if you want them; before DBUtil.load)

	// false when it could not connect. Stop here
	if (!DBUtil.load(Conf.conf().config(), App.class)) {
		throw new IllegalStateException("could not load the DB (the reason is in the log just above)");
	}

	JimbleServer.start(new App());

}
```

The second argument to `DBUtil.load` is the **classpath anchor** — migration SQL is
looked up from there. Pass a class of your own application.

> [!TRAP]
> **Do not throw the return value away.** `DBUtil.load` does not throw when it cannot
> connect — it logs the reason and returns `false`. Throw that away and **the server
> starts anyway**, then falls over on the first request that arrives.
> `DBUtil.getMainDB()` fails saying the DB was never loaded, so you will not be lost,
> but **noticing at startup is faster**.

> [!TRAP]
> **If your app has more than one entry point, put this sequence in one place.**
> Write it separately in the web, batch and scheduler mains and <b>one of them goes stale</b>.
> Tests call the same thing ([Pitfalls](./pitfalls) / [Testing](./testing)).

To shut down, call `DBUtil.stop()` (the web server does it as part of
[graceful shutdown](./server); in batches and tests you call it yourself).

## When there is more than one data source

```conf
db {
	main_db { main = true, ... }
	log_db  { ... }
}
```

`DBUtil.getDB("log_db")` gets you a different data source.
The one with `main = true` is `DBUtil.getMainDB()` (there is no no-argument `getDB()`).

Everything listed at the top level is **treated as its own thing**:

- migrations under `conf/migration/<data source name>/` are applied to it
- codegen generates `db/<data source name>/` for it
- `migration` / `db_lock` / `db_value` / `db_cache` are created there too

If all you want is **one more handle without copying the settings**, use `subs`.

```conf
db {
	main_db {
		main = true
		...
		subs {
			archive_db { }
		}
	}
}
```

Get it with `db.newSubDB("archive_db")`.

> [!TRAP]
> **Neither the connection nor the transaction is shared.** `subs` is a separate pool
> from its parent. Even when it points at the same database it is a different
> connection, so writing through `newSubDB` inside the parent's transaction
> **does not roll back with it** — one side stays. Assume it inherits the settings
> from the parent and nothing more.

> [!TRAP]
> **Migrations and codegen do not apply to `subs`.** Per-data-source work only runs
> for the top-level `db { }` entries. So all you can put in a `subs` is a scratch
> table the application creates itself. Anything that needs a schema and generated
> types (an audit log in another database, say) belongs in **a second top-level entry**.
> Also, if a `subs` points at a different database, **that database has to exist
> first**: `subs` connects while the parent data source is still being built, so a
> `create_database_sql` written on a later top-level entry does not arrive in time
> (startup stops with `failed create subs datasource`).

`examples/approval-data` has both a second top-level entry and a `subs`.

## Generate table definitions

```bash
./gradlew codegen
```

This generates one class per table from the DB schema.

```java
Post.id       // Column
Post.title
Post.instance()   // Table
```

Add the `io.jimble.db` plugin and `migrate → codegen → compileJava` are wired
together. Write DDL, start up, and the code catches up on its own.

```kotlin
plugins {
	id("io.jimble.db")
}
```

**Commit the generated classes to the repository.**
If you do not commit them, you cannot build in an environment with no DB.

## Selecting

```java
Data row = db.select(
	SQL.select()
		.from(Post.instance())
		.where(Post.id.eq(1L))
);

// SELECT の結果はテーブル名でネストする（要件 F-D-02）
String title = row.getData("post").getString("title");

// Column で引けば、途中の文字列が出てこない
String same = row.getString(Post.title);
```

**A SELECT result nests under the table name.**
Join `post` and `comment` and the `id` on each side does not collide.

Query with `Column` and no string keys show up in your code.
`row.getData(Post.instance())` pulls out one table's worth, **flattened**.

> [!TRAP]
> **`extractTableData` does not flatten.** It returns `{post: {...}}` **still nested**, so
> serialising that to JSON **leaves one level of nesting in**. To flatten, use
> `getData(table)` or `flattenTable(table)`.

## Reading errors

```java
try (DB db = BlogExample.db()) {

	List<Data> rows = db.selectList(SQL.select().from(Post.instance()));

	/*
	 * DB のエラーは例外ではなく戻り値で返る（要件 F-D-11）。
	 * select 系は null、更新系は -1。
	 */
	if (rows == null) {
		Log.error("引けませんでした: " + db.getError());
		return;
	}

}
```

DB errors come back as return values, not exceptions.
`select` returns `null`, `insert` returns `-1`, `update` / `delete` return `-1`.
The reason is in `db.getError()`.

## Migrations

Put them in `conf/migration/<schema name>/001_xxx.sql`.

```sql
# --- !Ups

CREATE TABLE `note` (
	`id`         BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'ID' PRIMARY KEY,
	`title`      VARCHAR(200)  NOT NULL COMMENT 'Title',
	`created_at` DATETIME      NOT NULL COMMENT 'Created at'
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin COMMENT='Note';

# --- !Downs

DROP TABLE `note`;
```

```bash
./gradlew migrate
```

What has already been applied is recorded, so it never runs twice.
When several servers start at once, a lock is taken and only one of them runs.

When each thing runs, what happens when one fails, and the type mapping that
gets generated are all in
[Migrations and code generation](./codegen).
