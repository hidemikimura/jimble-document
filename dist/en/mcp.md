# MCP

Expose your application's features in a form an AI can call.
What jimble implements is the **2026-07-28** revision, over two transports:
**Streamable HTTP** and **stdio**.

## Listing what you expose

```java
public class BlogMcp extends McpController {

	{
```

```java
tool("search_posts", SearchPostsTool::new);
tool("create_post", CreatePostTool::new);

resource("blog://latest", LatestPostsResource::new);
```

```java
	}

}
```

```java
install(BlogMcp::new);
```

**Read it top to bottom and you know everything this server exposes.**
No annotations, no classpath scanning. Java MCP implementations usually declare things with
annotations and scan at startup, and then you cannot tell which classes were picked up until you run it.

## Writing a tool

```java
public class GetWeatherTool implements McpTool {

	@Override
	public String description () {

		// ここはモデルが読む。いつ使うか・何ができないかを書く
		return "都市名から現在の天気を返す。過去や予報は返せない";

	}

	@Override
	public JsonSchema inputSchema () {

		return JsonSchema.object()
			.string("city", "都市名").required();

	}

	@Override
	public ToolResult call (WebContext context, Data arguments) {

		String city = arguments.getString("city");

		if (!isKnown(city)) {
			// モデルが読んで直せる失敗は、例外ではなく isError で返す
			return ToolResult.error("その都市は扱えません: %s".formatted(city));
		}

		return ToolResult.text(weatherOf(city));

	}

}
```

`description()` is **read by the model**. It is not a comment for humans.
Write when to use it, and **what it cannot do**.
One sentence saying it cannot return history or forecasts cuts out a lot of pointless calls.

You declare the shape of the input as JSON Schema.

```java
public JsonSchema inputSchema () {

	return JsonSchema.object()
		.string("title", "タイトル（%d 文字まで）".formatted(MAX_TITLE)).required()
		.string("body", "本文")
		.bool("published", "すぐ公開するか（既定は非公開）");

}
```

## Returning a failure

There are two kinds of failure.

| Which one | How to return it |
| --- | --- |
| The model can read it and fix it (bad argument, no such target) | `ToolResult.error("...")` |
| It cannot be fixed (the DB is down, the configuration is missing) | Throw an exception |

`ToolResult.error()` sets `isError` and returns it **as a normal response**.
The model reads that, changes the arguments, and calls again.
Turn it into an exception and all the model sees is "it broke".

## Exposing an API you already have

Often the API comes first and MCP comes later.
Write the same logic a second time inside the tool and **one of the two will go stale.** Guaranteed.

`RouteTool` **turns a route you have already registered into a tool, as it is**.

```java
public class BlogMcp extends McpController {

	{
		tool("list_posts", RouteTool.of("GET", "/api/posts")
			.description("Return the list of posts. page picks the page")
			.input(JsonSchema.object()
				.integer("page", "Page number, starting at 1").min(1)));

		tool("get_post", RouteTool.of("GET", "/api/posts/{id}")
			.description("Return one post")
			.input(JsonSchema.object()
				.string("id", "Post ID").required()));

		tool("create_post", RouteTool.of("POST", "/api/posts")
			.description("Create one post")
			.input(JsonSchema.object()
				.string("title", "Title").required()
				.string("body", "Body").required()));
	}

}
```

No HTTP is involved. The dispatcher **calls that route directly**.

> [!note]
> **`before` and `after` both apply.**
> An API with its authentication in a `before` is still authenticated when it is called through MCP
> (the headers and cookies of the MCP request carry straight through).
> There is no separate internal-only path, so **you cannot add authentication and forget one side**.

### Where each argument goes

| Argument | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| Same name as a `{name}` in the path | Into the path |
| The rest (`GET` / `DELETE` / `HEAD`) | The query string |
| The rest (anything else) | The JSON body |

Put the `{name}`s from the path into `input(...)` and mark them `required()`.
Leave them out and the model has no idea what to pass.

A route containing a wildcard (`/files/*`) **is refused at registration time**.
Letting it through with no way to fill it in would give you a silent 404 on every call.

### What comes back

| What the API returned | The tool result |
| --- | --- |
| 2xx with a JSON object | Both `structuredContent` and the body as text |
| 2xx with anything else | The body as text |
| 4xx | `isError` (**the body is passed through untouched**) |
| 5xx | `isError` (**the body is not passed**) |

A 4xx body was written for a client to read, so handing it to the model as-is lets the model
fix things ("no such post: 999").

A 5xx body was never written for anyone to read. Depending on the error handler it can carry
a stack trace, so **we do not pass it** (it still goes to the log).

### Things to watch for

- An API that takes an upload cannot be called (ownership of the temp file gets murky, so the file is empty)
- An API that returns a large file puts all of it in memory
- An API that returns bytes still compressed (`response().cache(...)`) becomes an `isError`, because it cannot be read

> [!trap]
> **If you can share the domain layer, do that first.**
> `RouteTool` is the tool for "I want to expose the thing that is **already assembled as an API** —
> validation, formatting, permissions and all — exactly as it is."
> The inside is **a different transaction from the outside**, so you cannot use it to call
> several APIs from one tool and commit them together.

### Calling it without a tool

The same machinery works from an ordinary handler.

```java
CallResponse response = context.dispatcher().call(context
	, CallRequest.of("GET", "/api/posts").query("page", "2"));

Data json = response.json();
```

Nesting has a limit (8).
A route that calls itself would go down forever, so it stops there and throws.

## Resources and prompts

```java
resource("blog://latest", LatestPostsResource::new);
prompt("summarize", SummarizePrompt::new);
```

A resource is read-only data. A prompt is a canned instruction.

## Running it over standard input and output

You can also skip HTTP entirely and let **the client start the process**.
This is what you want for local tooling, and anywhere you would rather not open a port.

```java
public class BlogStdio {

	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {

		Bootstrap.load();

		App app = new App();

		McpStdio.run(app, app.mcp().registry());

	}

}
```

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"blog": {
			"command": "java",
			"args": ["-cp", "app.jar", "blog.BlogStdio"]
		}
	}
}
```

**No port is opened, but the route table is still built.**
`RouteTool` (exposing an API you already have) and the `before` checks on those routes
behave exactly as they do over HTTP.

There is also `McpStdio.run(registry)`, without the application.
`RouteTool` cannot work there — with no route table, calling one says so instead.

### Do not write anything to standard output

The spec says **a server MUST NOT write anything but MCP messages to stdout**.
One stray log line and the client treats it as malformed JSON and drops the connection.

`McpStdio.run` does not ask you to be careful about this — **it makes it impossible**.
`McpStdio` keeps the real stdout to itself and replaces `System.out` with stderr.
Whatever the application prints, and whatever logback writes, goes to stderr
(clients are allowed to ignore stderr).

**It stops when standard input closes.** Open subscriptions are closed cleanly first,
then whatever was handed to `Shutdown` is stopped.

## Telling the client something changed

A client opens a subscription with `subscriptions/listen`.
That request never finishes: it becomes an SSE stream over HTTP, or the same stdout over stdio.

On your side it is one line, where the change happens.

```java
postDao.save(post);

McpNotify.resourceUpdated("blog://posts/" + post.getId());
```

- **Only what was asked for is delivered.** Other URIs are skipped
- With nobody subscribed, nothing happens
- `notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged` comes back first, carrying
  **only the kinds that were accepted**, so the client can compare it against what it asked for

**Only the two resource notifications can ever fire** (`resources/updated` and
`resources/list_changed`). Tools and prompts are registered explicitly at startup, so they
cannot appear or disappear while the server runs. Claiming support for something that will
never arrive is worse than saying no, so `toolsListChanged` is dropped from the acknowledgement.

## When a list gets long

`tools/list` and friends come back in pages.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"resources/list","params":{"cursor":"..."}}
```

- `nextCursor` is only present when there is more
- **The default is 100.** An application with fewer than that registered sees no change at all
- The cursor is opaque — **do not read it**
- **An unreadable cursor is refused** (`-32602`). Quietly restarting from the top would
  have the client read the same page forever, with no error anywhere

```conf
mcp {
	page_size = 100
}
```

## One way in

Over HTTP, the only thing exposed is `POST /mcp`.

- **GET and DELETE are both refused with a 405.** Both left the spec in 2026-07-28
- **There are no sessions.** `Mcp-Session-Id` is not used
- **The server never sends a request.** It only sends responses

To change the path, configure it.

```conf
mcp {
	path            = "/mcp"
	name            = "blog"
	version         = "1.0.0"
	allowed_origins = ["https://example.com"]
	page_size       = 100
	instructions    = "Search and post articles"
}
```

## Always configure Origin

Without `allowed_origins` there is nothing to check the `Origin` header against.
An MCP server a browser can reach is **a target for DNS rebinding**.
The more local the server, the more dangerous it is (`localhost` exists on everybody's machine).

## Connecting to it

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"blog": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "http://localhost:9000/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

A client starts with `server/discover` to find out which revisions the server speaks
and what it has. **That one call does not need the version header** — it is the call
you make to learn the version.
