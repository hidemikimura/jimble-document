# What jimble is

jimble is a web framework for Java. It sits on Helidon's Níma (virtual threads) and
gives you routing, DB, templates, batch, MQ, SSE, WebSocket, and MCP as one piece.

```java
get("/hello", context -> context.response().send("hello, jimble\n"));
```

## What makes it different

Most frameworks aim to reduce how much you write.
jimble aims to let **the person reading the code follow it top to bottom**.

- **No annotations.** There is no `@Controller`, no `@Inject`, no `@Transactional`.
  A route exists only where `get("/hello", ...)` is written.
- **No DI container.** You `new` your objects. Who creates whom is right there in the code.
- **No classpath scanning at startup.** Startup is fast, and nothing fights with native images.
  In exchange, you `install()` what you use yourself.

Hold to these three and the "why does this even work?" hours disappear.
The price is a few extra lines. jimble thinks that is the cheaper side of the trade.

## About versions

**This site describes the latest release.**
It is published only when a release is cut, so what you read here
**works on the version you can download**.

The releases are on
[Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/jimble/).
The dependency coordinates and a build file that works as it stands are on the
[Gradle plugins](./gradle) page; the source is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hidemikimura/jimble).
