# Sessions and safe defaults

## Sessions

```java
context.session().put("user_id", 42);

// 明示的に保存する（要件 F-S-02）。自動保存はしない
context.session().save();
```

**Nothing is saved automatically.** Nothing is written unless you call `save()`.
That is to avoid writing on every request that only ever read.

Choose where it is stored in `application.conf`.

```conf
session {
	store       = "db"     # none | db | redis | cookie
	cookie_name = "sid"
}
```

| store | Where it fits |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | You do not use sessions (the default) |
| `db` | Several servers. You have a DB |
| `redis` | Several servers. You need the speed |
| `cookie` | You want to keep nothing on the server. The contents are signed |

### Regenerate the session id on login

**Call `regenerateId()` as soon as the login succeeds.**

```java
context.session().regenerateId();          // new id, same contents
context.session().put("staff_id", staffId);
context.session().save();                  // the new id is issued here
```

If the id does not change across the login, **an id an attacker planted beforehand keeps
working and now carries the privileges** (session fixation). There is no shortage of ways
to plant one — a link on a public page, another subdomain, a browser extension.

**The contents are carried over.** Whatever you put in just before the login — the URL to
return to, a half-filled form, the CSRF token — **would otherwise vanish exactly when the
user logs in**, and they lose their place.

> [!TRAP]
> **Call `save()` after regenerating.** `regenerateId()` does not save (nothing here
> saves by itself). Regenerate without saving and **the old side is gone and the new side
> was never written** — the user is simply not logged in. It **fails closed**, so it is
> not dangerous, but "I logged in and got a 401" starts here.

What it does depends on the store:

| store | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `db` / `redis` | The old row is deleted and rewritten under the new id |
| `cookie` | **Nothing is keyed by the id**, so the contents cookie is simply rewritten (the old value is void — it is signed and encrypted) |
| `none` | Nothing |

## CSRF

```java
path("/form", () -> {

	/*
	 * 状態を変えるものだけ検証する。
	 * GET / HEAD / OPTIONS / TRACE は素通しする（Csrf.SAFE_METHODS）。
	 */
	before(Csrf::verify);

	get("", FormController::show);
	post("", FormController::submit);

});
```

Put `Csrf::verify` in a `before` and the routes below it are protected.
`GET` `HEAD` `OPTIONS` `TRACE` pass through untouched (`Csrf.SAFE_METHODS`).

Take the token with `context.request().csrfToken()` and put it in a hidden form field.

## Flash

Something you hand to the redirect target exactly once.

```java
context.flash().put("message", "Saved");
context.response().redirect("/");
```

It disappears the moment you read it. It travels signed, inside a cookie.

## Cookies default to secure = true

jimble's cookies carry `Secure` by default. They are only sent over HTTPS.

**Local runs on http, so with that default the browser never sends the cookie back.**
Sessions, CSRF, and flash all stop working — without an error.

This is the textbook silent failure, so jimble **logs a WARN at startup** when
`env=local` and `cookie.secure = true`.

```
cookie.secure = true のままです（env=local）。
ローカルは http なので、ブラウザは Cookie を送り返しません。
application.conf に次を足してください。
  cookie { secure = false }
```

> In English: "cookie.secure is still true (env=local). Local runs on http, so the
> browser will not send the cookie back. Add this to application.conf."

The `jimble new` skeleton ships with that stanza already in it.
**Delete it before you go to production.**

## Cookies

```java
// 30 days
context.cookies().put("last_post", String.valueOf(id), 30L * 24 * 60 * 60);

String lastPost = context.cookies().get("last_post");
```

**A value you write is readable again inside the same request.** If only received cookies
were visible, every re-read of a CSRF token you had issued a moment ago would hand you
a different one.

To sign a value, sign it with `Cookies.sign(value)` and put it in with `put(Cookie, plaintext)`.

**Read it back with `context.cookies().get("a name")` or `context.request().cookie("a name")`.**
A value whose signature did not check out never lands there — that is the point, so a tampered
value cannot reach your code.

> [!WARN]
> **`unsignCookie("a name")` does not verify the signature.**
> Despite the name, it hands back the **raw received value**, and an empty string — not `null` —
> when there is nothing. Use `cookie("a name")` when you want the verified value.

The key is `cookie.secret` in `application.conf` (`session.secret` for cookie sessions);
in production, pass it in from an environment variable.

```conf
cookie {
	secret = ${?COOKIE_SECRET}
}
```

**With no key set, signing is off entirely.** Nothing throws, cookies read and write as usual,
and there is no sign that it is not working — so we warn about it at startup.

## Rotating a key

**Keys can be rotated. Nobody gets logged out.**

Put the new key in `secret` and the outgoing one in `previous_secrets`.
**Writing always uses `secret`; `previous_secrets` is only tried when reading.**

```conf
cookie {
	secret           = ${?COOKIE_SECRET}       # the new key
	previous_secrets = [${?COOKIE_SECRET_OLD}] # the one being retired
}

session {
	secret           = ${?SESSION_SECRET}
	previous_secrets = [${?SESSION_SECRET_OLD}]
}
```

Three steps.

1. **Put the new key first and keep the old one in `previous_secrets`.** Deploy
2. **Wait.** As people come back, their old-key cookies get rewritten with the new key
3. **Drop `previous_secrets`.** Deploy again and you are done

### Knowing when step 3 is safe

**Do not guess.** How often an old key was needed shows up in the metrics (`Metrics.snapshot()`).

| Name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cookie.stale_secret` | Cookies read that were signed with an old key |
| `session.stale_secret` | Sessions read that were encrypted with an old key |

**Once these stop climbing, the old key can go.** The startup log carries the count too
(`鍵=cookie=2, session=2`): still 2 means the rotation is in flight — or that you forgot to
drop `previous_secrets`.

If it never quite reaches zero, that is people who come back rarely. Cookies expire at
`cookie.max_age` (a year by default), so that is the longest you would ever wait.

### Cookies you wrote are yours to rewrite

`sid` and `csrf_token` are re-signed for you. **Cookies your app wrote with `cookies().put(...)`
are not** — only the code that wrote one knows what its lifetime should be, and the browser
does not send it back.

```java
if (context.cookies().isStale("last_post")) {
	context.cookies().put("last_post", context.cookies().get("last_post"), 30 * 24 * 60 * 60);
}
```

They still read fine if you skip this; you just cannot drop the old key until they expire.

### Password keys cannot be rotated this way

**`cipher.key` and `hash.password.pepper` are outside this mechanism.**
What they produce lives in a **password column in your database**, not in a cookie, and the only
moment it can be rewritten is **a successful login** — that is the only time the plaintext exists.
So as long as one person has not logged in lately, the old key has to stay.

To change them, do this in your application:

1. Switch `createHash` over to the new key
2. **On a successful login, if the stored hash is in the old form, rebuild and save it**
   (`check(input, hash, encrypted)` lets you name the form to check against)
3. Retire the old key once everyone has moved over

jimble cannot tell you when step 3 is safe. **Decide it from something your application knows —
counting accounts whose last login is old, for instance.**

## Passwords

`PasswordUtil` hashes with BCrypt. **Whether it then encrypts is yours to choose.**

```java
String hash = PasswordUtil.createHash(password);

if (PasswordUtil.check(input, user.getString("password"))) {
	// it matched
}
```

```conf
hash {
	password {
		# Default: true when cipher.key is set, false when it is not
		encrypt = true
		pepper  = ${?PASSWORD_PEPPER}
	}
}

cipher {
	key = ${?CIPHER_KEY}   # 16 / 24 / 32 bytes
	iv  = ${?CIPHER_IV}    # 16 bytes
}
```

**The default is "encrypt if a key is there."** Pin it to a hard `false` and an existing app
that stores encrypted hashes will compare them as plaintext even though the key is
configured — and **nobody can log in any more.** Which mode you are running in shows up
in the startup log (`パスワード暗号化=あり`). Write `encrypt` when you want it stated.

Turning encryption on or off later means rebuilding the hashes you already stored.
`createHash(password, encrypt)` and `check(input, hash, encrypted)` let you pin each side
on its own.

`CipherUtil` is **AES/CBC with a fixed IV.** It is kept so that ciphertext already in your
database can still be read. **Do not use it for anything you encrypt from now on.** The same
plaintext always produces the same ciphertext, and there is no tamper detection.
For anything new, use `Aead` (AES-256-GCM).
